# This is a GitHub Actions workflow file named "CodeQL".
# It is designed to perform CodeQL analysis on your Python project.
# CodeQL is a semantic code analysis engine, used mostly for detecting vulnerabilities across a codebase.
name: "CodeQL"

# The workflow is triggered by three events:
# 1. A push to "master" branch
# 2. A pull request to "master" branch
# 3. A scheduled event that runs every Friday at 10:44 UTC
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]
